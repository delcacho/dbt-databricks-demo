This repository contains the Marketing Attribution demo from DBT, adapted to work on top of the Databricks connector. Some corrections had to be made on the original code because the Spark SQL syntax seems to be slightly different than vanilla SQL, specially with regards to Date handling. The project profile file has been modified to work with the latest version of DBT.

Tested against the following environment:

```
dbt-bigquery                                  0.21.1
dbt-core                                      1.0.4
dbt-databricks                                1.0.0
dbt-extractor                                 0.4.0
dbt-postgres                                  0.21.1
dbt-redshift                                  0.21.1
dbt-snowflake                                 0.21.1
dbt-spark                                     1.0.0
```

There is a companion Databricks notebook with some visualizations to showcase the capabilities of the Databricks platform in terms of IDE environment for exploratory data analysis. It can be used to inspect the results after running the DB project offline. For instructions on how to connect to DBT, please follow the guideline contained in the notebook:

# Attribution playbook
This dbt project is a worked example to demonstrate how to model customer
attribution. **Check out the full write-up [here](https://blog.getdbt.com/modeling-marketing-attribution/),
as well as the documentation site for this project [here](https://www.getdbt.com/attribution-playbook/#!/overview).**

Note that this project is not a package -- it is not intended to be installed in
your own dbt project, but instead provides a good starting point for building
similar data models for your own business.

The SQL in this project is compatible with SnowflakeÂ¹.

If you want to run this project yourself to play with it (assuming you have
dbt installed):
1. Clone this repo.
2. Create a profile named `playbook`, or update the `profile:` key in the
`dbt_project.yml` file to point to an existing profile ([docs](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configure-your-profile)).
3. Run `dbt deps`.
4. Run `dbt seed`.
5. Run `dbt run` -- if you are using a warehouse other than Snowflake, you may
find that you have to update some SQL to be compatible with your warehouse.
6. Run `dbt test`.

-----
1. We decided to _not_ make the SQL multi-warehouse compatible since this project
is intended to be a demonstration, rather than a package. Making this project
multi-warehouse compatible would complicate the SQL.
